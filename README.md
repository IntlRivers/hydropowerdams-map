The Sub-Saharan African Hydropower Dams Map is an ongoing open source project, mapping prospective and existing dams across the region. It details financial, environmental and social consequences of the projects, and explores the impact of dam development projects by overlaying visual data from various resources.

For questions or any suggestions please email contact@internationalrivers.org. 

## How it Works
The Hydropower Dams Map utilizes the frontend Nextjs React framework to display the map and user interface. External libraries and APIs are used to retrieve the necessary datasets to display on the map. Please read the Technical Documentation for a detailed overview of the project.

## Current Map Features
- Interactive map with zoom and pan capabilities.
- Marker for each dam with visual indexing based on the toggled layer.
- Filter and search functionality for dams.
- Layer control to toggle data overlays.
- Filterable legends for layers

## Datasets and Attribution
Some of the datasets used by the Hydropower Dams Map are powered by [Resource Watch API](https://resourcewatch.org/), an open-source API by the [World Resource Institute](https://www.wri.org/).
